# FEMA-FFRD GitHub Organization
This repo contains the policies and discussions for the fema-ffrd organization.  

**General disclaimer** This organization was created for use by FEMA and USACE programs to collaborate on projects in support of the [Future of Flood Risk Data](https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/future-flood-risk-data-ffrd) (FFRD) initiative. GitHub is not hosted by FEMA or USACE, but is a third party website used by FEMA and its partners to share information and collaborate on software. FEMA and USACE use of GitHub does not imply an endorsement of any one particular service, product, or enterprise.

## Guidelines for using the fema-ffrd organization
There are few requirements for participating in the ffrd-fema organization, and some recommendations below:

### User Profiles
We understand there are reasons for maintaining a pseudonymous profile on Github, we do requre that the profile you use as a member of this organization be set up so that we can collaborate more effectively, as of 25-Jan-2024 we will be requiring all member profiles to include: 

- Name: Your first and last name.
- Company: Your government agency or contracting company.
- Location: Your primary work location (city, state).
- Photo: A headshot photo, or an appropriate image that is unique to you.

Note that if you do not want to mix your work and personal profile, we recommend you create a separate account tied to your work e-mail address and use that for fema-ffrd projects.

### 2FA
You must have 2-Factor authentication turned on for your account, this is just a good idea in general.

## Recomendations for your repositories
We aren't going to be enforcing these, but as a general rule, it's a good idea to set up your project with the following notices and license.  Feel free to use another license, the Apache 2 license lines up pretty well with the overall regulations, MIT is another good option.
